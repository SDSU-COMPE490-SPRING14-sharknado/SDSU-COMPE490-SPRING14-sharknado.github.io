title: Competition Day
---

Today was competition day. This is the culmination of our last few months of work. It did not go as well as we had anticipated. Our GPS navigation routines were not operating normally. Under all our previous tests, GPS positioning was accurate up to 2 meters almost 100% of the time. However, today we could only get within 2 meters about 25% of the time or less. It was a clear sunny day so GPS signals would not have been obscured. We had GPS navigation almost perfected about a month ago and have been working on ultrasonic obstacle avoidance for the past few weeks. The day before the competition, the ultrasonic sensor started breaking and/or operating strangely. We suspect some bad PCB board may have been shorting them out possibly. So, in other words, we were disappointed with the performance we had today, but we are looking forward to design day tomorrow!
