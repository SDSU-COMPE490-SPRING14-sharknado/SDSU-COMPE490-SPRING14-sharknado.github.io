Good Progress since last post. Sharknado's deadline is less than a week away. 

####Obstacle Avoidance (Ultrasonic Sensors)

Since last post we have made a pretty good implementation of obstacle-avoidance using the ultrasonic sensors. One difficulty in the implementation was that the naive approach to the sensors involves blocking code that caused our system's whole feedback to slow down by a factor of 3 (3 sensors). Arduino's pulseIn function blocks until it returns w/ a timeout of 1 second. In the worst case this means our system will have a 3 second feedback loop, much too slow! We came up w/ a more sophisticated non-blocking solution using timers and interrupts. W/ the async sensors our feedback loop averages about 210ms. Below is an example of the non-blocking code:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/eggie5/11356172.js"></script>

Through experimentation we find that the sensors work at about a range of 137cm +/-10 cm. Once we get a hit on any of the sensors we transition our state machine to `ESCAPE` mode where we turn accordingly. We haven't really spent much time on this routine yet.

Our system has lots of noise, so sometimes we get erroneous readings and our interrupts count those as hits so our vehicle will randomly swerve as it turns to avoid an obstacle that isn't there. I tried a few filtering methods, sliding-window-median and FIR, however, the tradeoffs w/ filters really makes it unattractive. Since the distance of the sensors is so small, by the time we process the hit, it is too late to respond by stoping. This is still a problem we are researching. 

####Magnetometer FIR Filter

Our magnetometers readings have a lot of noise to them, especially as the vehicle is bumping around while driving. I was experimenting w/ a sliding window median of 5 filter to mitigate some of this noise, however, my team said it caused the steering compensation (PID system) to sway back and forth, meaning the response of the filter was too slow. I want to try a FIR filter on it because it has a faster response while removing some of the noise.

The above figure is the raw samples from the compass and the FIR filtered results as Sharknado is sitting on my desk not moving. In theory the heading should be static, but it has a large variance, swinging +/-2 degrees from the mean of 81.9 degrees w/ s.d. of 1.04. However, w/ the FIR filtering in place we reduce the sd. by half (.54) put a tighter bound on the max/min. However, does the filter respond faster than medians?

In the figure above, I test the response of the filter. I move the vehicle rapidly 45 degrees and check how far behind the filter lags (in red). it's not too bad, but I am pretty sure that the PID system will achieve the best results w/ the real time data and it will compensate for any large sings (error) w/ the I tern in PID, so using a filter is kinda redundant.

####Beacon Sensor Antenna Circuit

This is a circuit that is tuned to a 40KHz signal emitted from a beacon on the ground. We get samples from this sensor using a A/D conversion. This circuit is very sensitive and receives a lot of interference from our motors (EM radiation):

![medians](/public/images/medians_fig.png)

The above figure is a set of samples from the stationary sensor w/ the sharknado motors running. There is no beacon present, however we get a reading of 40 just from EM radiation from the motors. We can establish this as our baseline and any signal above 40 can be considered a true signal from our beacon. Meaning anything above that hysteresis margin can be considered a signal from the beacon. However, the raw signal spikes a lot so I implemented a median w/ a sliding window of size 7. This allows a good smoothing w/ a decent response. Additionally, the filter reduces the S.D. to 2.6 from to 7.8.


###Summary

At this point sharknado has all the required sensors to complete the challenge. From this point on we need to fine tune the obstacle avoidance and the beacon antenna. Also, s'nado needs a lot chassis work, but we just got the PCB back so it wire mess will soon be cleaned up.
